# LabVIEW Control for Zeiss Microscopes
This is an open source control software for Zeiss microscopes. This software has been tested on an AxioVert epifluorescence microscope. This software requires both LabView from National Instruments and Micro Toolbox (MTB) from Zeiss. LabVIEW can be purchased from [National Instruments](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html), and MTB can be requested from [Zeiss](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/downloads/micro-toolbox-mtb-.html).
